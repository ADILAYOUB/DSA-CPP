// Fundamental 

/*
  
  
  Problem ==> Solution ===> Rough Solution/ flow chart / pseudo code ==> high level language ==> Machine understanding language 


  compiler ==> convert code into machine understandable language

  e.g Prime number:
  13 is prime number how to find
  number divided by 1 and itself > algo 

  Coding is labour we have to be the one who writes the algo to solve the problem 


  1. Flow chart : alog in graphical format 
  
  2. Pseudo code : alog in text format
  example: Sum of two numbers

  Start Program
  Input two numbers
  Add two numbers
  Print the result
  End Program
